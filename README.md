## Project setup
Follow these steps to serve this project on your local computer.

*Required:* Node.js installed on your device

This application is a high-fidelity prototype made with a mobile first approach. The current format of the application have only been designed for phone sized deviced, spesifically the Google Pixel 2 XL device. The following steps will detail how you can host the application on your local computer and view it in your browser and on your phone.

1. Open up this project in a code editor or IDE.
2. Open up the terminal and run the following command: 
```
npm install
```
3. When the installation is complete, run this second command:
```
npm run serve
```

4. The page is best viewed on a mobile phone. If you however prefer to view it on the computer, continue to step 5. To open up the application on your phone look for the network address in the computer terminal and enter that adress into the phone browser url field.

5. To see the application on your computer either follow step four, but instead of using your phone, do the same on your computer, or open up your web browser to http://localhost:8080/. Note, your terminal might tell you differently.

6. Open up the developer inspect tool. If you use google chrome you can right click and click inspect towards the bottom or use the following hotkey combination:
```
ctrl + shift + i
```
7. Once the inspector is open, click the toggle device toolbar button in the upper left corner of the inspector window or use the following hotkey combination:
```
ctrl + shift + m
```
8. Continue to select Pixel 2 XL from the dropdown menu which normally is set to responsive. This can be found on the far left on the device toolbar that comes up after you finished step 6.
